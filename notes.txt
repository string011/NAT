From a new Ubuntu machine. 
Friday night.
Steps:
- Installed JDK8.
- Installed Eclipse.
- Installed Gradle.
- Fixed .bashrc $PATH to find gradle.
- Ran gradle to create an Eclipse project.
- Imported NAT project into Eclipse.
- Learned some gradle.
- Spent some time looking over the project structure and learning the Spring annotiations (I've not used Spring since XML config days, and way before all the AOP stuff was built)

Saturday:
- Spent time playing with JPA annotations for doing @OneToMany mapping. It is similar to JDO also more learning curve on Spring stuff like Repositories etc. The initial models I started with are really overkill for this project. Once I figured out the web service side of things, that became readily apparent.

- Got into the NAT api and JSON parsing. Was able to GET and POST to the nerdery.com repo

- Learned some stuff about Freemarker (never used that before) and integrated the example .html files into .ftl.

- Figured out where to put the .css assets/etc. so they could be picked up by the application at runtime. I'm not used to this project structure, still not sure where the system knows to pull stuff from the src/main/resources directory. I need to understand this better.

Sunday:
- Started writing the models, and controllers for pulling REST data and presenting it on the page. Wrote converter as well.

- Got stymied by the FTL programming model and javasctript cookie madness.
